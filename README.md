# COP2000_Project8

Using OOP, write a C++ program that will read in a file of names and a file of birth years.  The file of names is called Names.txt and the file of birth years is called BirthYear.txt.  Both input files should be located in the current directory of your program. 
The list of names in the Names.txt file corresponds to the list of birth years in the BirthYears.txt file. 

This means:
The first name in the names.txt file has the birth year of the first year in the birthyear.txt file. 
The second name in the names.txt file corresponds to the second birth year in the birthyear.txt file...and so on.

Read in and store the names into an array of 30.  Next read in and store the birth years into another array of 30 integers.

Sort the arrays using the selection sort or the bubblesort code found in your textbook.  List the roster of names in ascending alphabetical order displaying their birth years beside their names.

Next, prompt the user to enter a birth year.  Validate this input value.  Valid birth years are between the years 1995 - 2005.   List each name who has the birth year entered by the user.
